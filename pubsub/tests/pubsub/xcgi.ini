# Sample ini file for a single xcgi program. Note that you are free
# to add your own name/value pairs and then use them in your program
# as long as the name does not start with "xcgi_".
#
# For example, your code could do the following:
#  const char *upload_dir = xcgi_cfg_get (xcgi_config, "upload-dir");
# While in this file you could define 'upload-dir' as follows:
#  upload-dir = /tmp/uploads
#

# Database selection
# A database is needed if you are using any of the user/groups/perms
# management functions.
#
# You can choose between SQLITE or POSTGRES for the database type.
# For 'sqlite' the dbstring contains the filename of the database. For
# 'postgres' the dbstring contains the connection string for the
# PostgreSQL database; Check the Postgres documentation for the format
# and content of these strings.
xcgi_dbtype = sqlite
xcgi_dbstring = localdb.sqlite
