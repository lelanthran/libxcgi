1. Add support for parsing multi-part input with multiple file uploads.
2. Add support for parsing JSON input.
3. Create an example program; maybe a framework that allows the caller to
   map urls to functions?

===============
4. Create the skeleton pubsub.cgi application. For now simply accepting
   and responding to the API (even if responding with junk data) is
   enough.

5. Move the directories around - the main libxcgi.so should not be
   polluted with functions that are intended for the pubsub (and other)
   example applications.
