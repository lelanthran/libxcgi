1. Add support for parsing multi-part input with multiple file uploads.
2. Add support for parsing JSON input.
3. Create an example program; maybe a framework that allows the caller to
   map urls to functions?

4. Create the skeleton pubsub.cgi application. For now simply accepting
   and responding to the API (even if responding with junk data) is
   enough.
